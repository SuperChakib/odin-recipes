    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These taquitos are air fried, which makes them healthier than deep fried ones. Using shredded rotisserie chicken
    provides a quick prep but you can always use home-cooked chicken. Serve with sides of sour cream, Mexican tomato sauce,
    and guacamole, or your choice of sides.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped green chiles (such as Ortega®)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Mexican-style hot tomato sauce (such as El Pato®)</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Neufchatel cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 each corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1 serving avocado oil cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until
        fragrant, about 1 minute. Add green chiles and Mexican tomato sauce; stir to combine. Add chicken, Neufchatel cheese,
        and Mexican cheese blend. Cook and stir until cheeses have melted and mixture is completely warmed, about 3 minutes.
        Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat tortillas in a skillet or directly on the grates of a gas stove until soft and pliable. Place 3 tablespoons of
        chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Fold over and roll into taquitos.</li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place taquitos in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching, and mist with avocado oil. Cook in batches if
        necessary. Cook until golden brown and crispy, 6 to 9 minutes. Turn taquitos over, mist with avocado oil, and air fry
        for an additional 3 to 5 minutes.</li>   
    </ol>
